# Titanic-Survival-Analysis

<b>📌 Project Overview</b>

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore factors that influenced passenger survival during the disaster. Using Python with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the dataset is cleaned, processed, and visualized to uncover meaningful insights.

<b>🎯 Objective</b>

The objective of this project is to identify and visualize the key factors affecting survival, with a focus on gender, age, class, and fare, by applying data analysis and visualization techniques.

<b>📊 Key Features</b>

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categories)

Survival analysis by:

  >  Gender – female passengers survived more than males

  >  Age groups – children survived the most, seniors the least

  >  Passenger class – 1st class survival rate highest, 3rd class lowest

  >  Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between features

  >  Combined analysis of Gender + Class to highlight survival differences

<b>🛠️ Tools & Libraries</b>

  >  Python

  >  Pandas – data handling

  >  Seaborn – visualization (barplots, countplots, heatmaps)

  >  Matplotlib – custom charts

<b>📈 Results & Insights</b>

  >  Women and children had significantly higher survival rates.

  >  1st class passengers were much more likely to survive than 3rd class.

  >  Fare showed a positive correlation with survival, while Age had little effect.

  >  Across all classes, females outlived males.
